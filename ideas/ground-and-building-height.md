# Use the terrain and buildings height information to avoid the RTL crash to objects

> Idea: The ArduPilot has [Terrain Following](https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/common-terrain-following.html#terrain-following) feature. If I can add  buildings height to the database, it can avoid the drone crach to buildings.

## Actions

- Test the Terrain Following feature
- Collect buildings height information
